HomeKit-ESP8266-Stepper motor

Want to use Arduino-HomeKit-ESP8266 by Mixiaoxiao to control a stepper motor (ULN2003 driver).
I have used the "simple-LED" sketch in his library with no problem and are trying to adapt it for a stepper motor instead.

Struggling to understand the architecture as I'm sure you can see. 
So please feel free to make pull request!
